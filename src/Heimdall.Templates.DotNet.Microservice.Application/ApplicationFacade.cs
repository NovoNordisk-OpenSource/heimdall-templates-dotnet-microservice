/// <remarks>
///     The facade design pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
///     In this case, the ApplicationFacade acts as a high-level interface that hides the complexities of the application
///     layer of the microservice.
///     It encapsulates the interactions with the underlying components, such as the MediatR library, and provides a
///     unified and simplified API for the clients to interact with.
///     By using the facade pattern, the application layer becomes more modular, maintainable, and easier to use, as the
///     clients don't need to be aware of the internal details and dependencies of the subsystem.
